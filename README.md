# Arch

`sudo pacman -S sdcc`

`paru rabbitsign`

`paru tilp` TODO this doesnt work

# Ubuntu

`sudo apt install sdcc tilp2`

you also need `rabbitsign`, but the stock package seems to not work quite right\
as a workaround you can use an arch distrobox and export arch's rabbitsgn

this resulting executable doesn't work quite right tho
